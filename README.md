# Super-Resolution Project

A project exploring neural super-resolution on low-resolution images. This repo showcases a simple approach using coordinate encoding to upscale images.

## Main Contribution

- SuperResolutionFibonacci.py: Implements a custom super-resolution model with Fibonacci-inspired coordinate encoding for texture generation. [View Code](https://github.com/JZX100II/Super-Resolution/blob/main/SuperResolutionFibonacci.py)

## Results

- **Before (Base Image 1748)**:

- **After (Super Resolution Fibonacci 1748)**:

## Notes

- Built on the CIFAR-10 dataset for experimentation.
- Results are exploratory, with inherent blurriness due to low-res input limitations.
